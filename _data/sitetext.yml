    text: "Why this work exists"
    body: |
      Recode Leadership was created to support leaders who don’t fit the traditional mold — and who want to explore what it means to lead in a way that is truly their own.

      Many of us have been criticized for how we show up:

      - We are quieter.
      - We are more thoughtful.
      - We lead with care.
      - We take time to make considered decisions.

      And yet, we are also high-achieving leaders.

      - We are capable and trusted.
      - We lead with integrity and heart.
      - We balance business needs with care for people.
      - We deliver meaningful, lasting results.

      We are more than the traits others have misunderstood or undervalued.

      At Recode Leadership, we believe leadership can take many shapes — and that strong leadership honors both people and outcomes. Leaders deserve to be recognized not for how closely they match a mold, but for the impact they create by being themselves.

      This work exists to support you in becoming a leader who is respected, valued, and recognized for who you truly are.

    title: "Our Approach"
    text: "The philosophy behind this work"
    body: |
      You already have the strengths that brought you here — the thoughtfulness, dedication, and quiet excellence that make you a trusted leader.
      
      But we’re often conditioned to focus on what we lack, instead of what makes us effective.

      Our work together shifts that focus. We’ll uncover and amplify the strengths and qualities that already make you exceptional — and use them to help you rise confidently toward the career and leadership you want.

      Through the **RISE Framework**, a 4-part process, you’ll learn to grow with clarity, confidence, and authenticity:

      1. **Recognize what’s not working** — We’ll start by understanding what’s keeping you unseen or stuck. You’ll gain clarity on your current challenges and the invisible patterns that may be holding you back.

      2. **Illuminate your strengths** — Together, we’ll uncover what makes you naturally effective. You’ll learn to use your authentic ways of thinking, relating, and leading as tools for visibility and influence.

      3. **Strengthen your impact** — You’ll practice using your voice, presence, and strategies to lead with calm authority — in a way that earns recognition while staying true to who you are.

      4. **Elevate your leadership** — We’ll recode your definition of success, so you can grow your career in a way that’s sustainable, fulfilling, and aligned with your values.

      You’ve always led with thoughtfulness, care, and integrity. But somewhere along the way, you started to wonder — “Do people even see the value I bring?”

      At Recode Leadership, we help and guide quiet leaders at every stage of their journey rise into recognition — by amplifying their strengths and qualities so they’re noticed and valued for who they truly are, beyond their quietness.

      *If this sounds familiar, you’re in the right place.*

      You’re dependable, thoughtful, and deeply committed to your work. But lately you might find yourself:

      - Feeling overlooked, even though you deliver results.
      - Second-guessing your impact or wondering how to advocate for yourself and your team.
      - Wanting to grow — but unsure what’s holding you back.
      - Struggling to stay true to yourself while navigating cultural, confidence, or workplace expectations.
      
      You don’t need to become someone else to be seen. You just need to learn how to amplify the strengths you already have.

      That’s what we help you do.

    title: "Meet Amy"
    text: "Why I do this work"
    subtext: |
      Hi, I'm Amy. I am the founder and leadership & executive coach at Recode Leadership.

      I help quiet, high-achieving leaders to lead with confidence so they can be recognized and valued for who they truly are.

      I wasn’t born a leader. I rarely raised my hand to lead a team or share my opinion. I quietly observed others who were eager to speak up and take charge, thinking they had it all figured out — while I silently delivered results behind the scenes.

      Over time, I noticed something: people followed me. They asked for my help, sought my opinions, and trusted me to get things done. Yet I didn’t feel confident. I shied away from the spotlight because I didn’t fit the “traditional” mold of a leader — I was quiet, soft-spoken, and often let others go first.

      Eventually, I realized that in order to share my gifts and help others thrive, I had to step into the discomfort of visibility. I wanted to lead — but on my own terms. Instead of mimicking what others did or what the textbooks said, I leaned into my own strengths: quiet observation, thoughtfulness, kindness, and prudence.

      That approach shaped my leadership journey — a 20+ year career in engineering and technology, from individual contributor roles to team lead, engineering manager, and director, across aerospace at Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company, civic tech nonprofits like Code for America, education at Hackbright Academy, and federal agencies including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and 18F.
      
      I currently serve as a board member at the Asian Women Coaching Collective.
      
      I earned a BA in Computer Science from UC Berkeley, an MS in Software Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, completed the Professional Coach Training Program Phase 1: Core Essentials at CoachU, and became an Associate Certified Coach (ACC) through the International Coaching Federation. 
      
      Throughout my career, I’ve also volunteered my time and expertise to causes supporting underserved communities — work that continues to be deeply meaningful to me.

      If you’re ready to lean into your quiet nature and lead from your strengths, you’re in the right place. I’m here to help you do just that.

      - text: "Amy is an exceptional leadership coach who fills a critical gap; supporting quiet leaders who don't fit the profile of a traditional \"charismatic extrovert.\" Amy focuses on this underserved area, understanding that some lead through listening, reflection, and considered action rather than commanding the room. Despite years in leadership roles, I was surprised by both a strength and a weakness Amy helped me identify. She was an insightful sounding board, helping me clarify a situation I had been avoiding. She worked with my natural style, giving me space to think and explore while identifying patterns and practical actions. If you are a quiet leader who has not felt that traditional leadership advice fits, I highly recommend Amy."
        author: "Government Technology Executive"
      - text: "I have found Amy’s coaching style and sessions to be incredibly helpful in determining how best to leverage the strengths of myself and my team(s) and navigating challenging situations!  Amy excels at not only listening to the information and challenges I share with her, but also hearing and picking up what I may not be saying or seeing myself.  She will reflect things back to me in ways that help me see different perspectives or alternatives to approaching a situation, or reframe an idea in a way that is much better suited for whatever I might be facing.  This has enabled me to tap into my existing strengths while bolstering other areas in ways that are consistent with my values and align with the goals I am trying to achieve.  Thank you, Amy!"
        author: " Crlo C, Senior Engineering Leader"
      - text: "Amy is a leadership coach with a unique ability to deeply listen. She is excellent in providing a reflective calming space for me to both process my thoughts and recognize what is most essential. Amy is also one of the most kind hearted people I know, and I am appreciative of our coaching sessions as each one provides a place for me to optimally integrate my learnings and to show up as both a highly self-aware human being and a well grounded leader."
        author: "King L., Executive Leadership & Global Scaling Coach"
      - text: "Amy’s use of powerful questioning challenges me to think deeply and uncover insights I hadn’t considered, which helps me with my goals and motivations. Her ability to reframe perspectives enables me to see challenges in a more positive light, turning obstacles into opportunities for growth. The focus on mindset shifts has been transformative, as it helps me to use growth-oriented approach, and taking setbacks as learning experiences rather than failures."

        author: "Jenny W., Designer"
      - text: "Amy is a wonderful coach! She was very patient and helped me gain the confidence that I needed to move forward in the next steps of my career.

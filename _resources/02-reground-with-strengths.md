When leadership feels unsteady — especially during periods of uncertainty, change, or low morale — this framework offers a way to pause, reflect, and reconnect with your strengths. It was created to support leaders who continue showing up and serving, even when the environment around them feels unstable.

This resource is especially helpful if you’re navigating uncertainty, feeling overlooked, or questioning your impact, and want something practical yet gentle to help you regain clarity and grounding without needing to change who you are.

This framework comes from a closing keynote I delivered at GovLoop’s NextGen Summit in October 2025, during a time of significant uncertainty for federal employees. It was designed to help government leaders reconnect with what grounds them amid shutdowns, transitions, and declining morale.

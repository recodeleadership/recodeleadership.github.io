Being Amok is a collection of reflections and essays exploring what it means to lead from the inside out. It’s a space for naming the quieter tensions of leadership — visibility, belonging, identity, and growth — especially for those who don’t fit the traditional mold.

If you’re someone who thinks deeply, feels deeply, and wants language for what’s happening beneath the surface, this writing is for you.

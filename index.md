You’ve always led with thoughtfulness, care, and integrity.
But somewhere along the way, you started to wonder —
“Do people even see the value I bring?”

At Recode Leadership LLC, I help and guide quiet leaders at every stage of their journey rise into recognition — by amplifying their strengths and qualities so they’re noticed and valued for who they truly are, beyond their quietness.

# If this sounds familiar, you're in the right place.
You’re dependable, thoughtful, and deeply committed to your work.
But lately you might find yourself:

- Feeling overlooked, even though you deliver results.
- Second-guessing your impact or wondering how to advocate for yourself and your team.
- Wanting to grow — but unsure what’s holding you back.
- Struggling to stay true to yourself while navigating cultural, confidence, or workplace expectations.

You don’t need to become someone else to be seen.
You just need to learn how to amplify the strengths you already have.

That’s what I help you do.

# 🌼 My Approach
You already have the strengths that brought you here — the thoughtfulness, dedication, and quiet excellence that make you a trusted leader.

But we’re often conditioned to focus on what we lack, instead of what makes us effective.

Our work together shifts that focus. We’ll uncover and amplify the strengths and qualities that already make you exceptional — and use them to help you rise confidently toward the career and leadership you want.

Through the RISE Framework, a 4-part process, you’ll learn to grow with clarity, confidence, and authenticity.

## The RISE Framework
1. **Recognize what’s not working** —
We’ll start by understanding what’s keeping you unseen or stuck. You’ll gain clarity on your current challenges and the invisible patterns that may be holding you back.

2. **Illuminate your strengths** —
Together, we’ll uncover what makes you naturally effective. You’ll learn to use your authentic ways of thinking, relating, and leading as tools for visibility and influence.

3. **Strengthen your impact** —
You’ll practice using your voice, presence, and strategies to lead with calm authority — in a way that earns recognition while staying true to who you are.

4. **Elevate your leadership** —
We’ll recode your definition of success, so you can grow your career in a way that’s sustainable, fulfilling, and aligned with your values.

# 💫 Meet Amy
![Amy Mok](/assets/amymok.jpeg)

Hi, I’m [Amy Mok](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amymok/) — a coach for quiet, high-achieving professionals who want to be recognized and valued for their impact.

For years, I worked hard, delivered results, and supported others quietly — yet often felt unseen.

It wasn’t until I began my own coaching journey that I realized: I didn’t need to change myself to be valued. I needed to understand my strengths, trust my voice, and lead in a way that felt like me.

That’s what I help my clients do.

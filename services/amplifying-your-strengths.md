### The Environment We’re In

The workplace feels uncertain right now. With restructurings, cuts, and constant change, many leaders are simply trying to hold steady. In these moments, it’s often the loudest voices who rise to the surface—leading the new initiative, getting promoted to the next leadership role.

For quiet leaders, this can feel disheartening. You are deeply committed, steady in crisis, and thoughtful in your decisions—yet your contributions risk being overshadowed simply because you’re not the one filling the airspace.

You also want to protect your team, hold space for them, and continue doing work that matters. You want your contributions—and theirs—to be seen and recognized. But in an environment where visibility feels tied to survival, the quiet can feel risky.

I’ve seen this happen too often: a quiet, highly capable leader delivers strong results, but when leadership assigns a new initiative, they hand it to the person who’s always the first to speak up. Not because they’re more capable—but because they’re more visible.

And so you may wonder:
- Will I be overlooked—or worse, will my team be discounted—if I don’t take up more space?
- Do I need to speak more, show more, prove more—just to be seen for my people and me?


### The Struggle You Carry

Over your career, you may have heard:
- “Speak up more.”
- “Be more visible.”
- “Be more confident.”


Even as you’ve stepped into leadership roles, doubts still linger:
- In meetings, your thoughts can get lost when others jump in first.
- In reviews, you wish your impact was obvious without having to sell yourself.
- With your team, you want to be present and heard, but not forced into taking all the airspace.


It’s exhausting to feel like you have to work twice as hard to be noticed beyond your quietness.


### The Possibility
Here’s the truth: you don’t need to become louder or someone you’re not.

Your strengths already hold your voice. Some are clear to you, others may be waiting quietly beneath the surface. When those strengths are amplified, they speak for you in the moments that matter most.

Imagine…
- In that leadership meeting, your contributions land with weight—even if you don’t say the most words.
- In your next review, your value is already recognized without you having to prove endlessly.
- With your team, your presence is steady and felt—without taking all the airspace.


This is what becomes possible when your strengths are invited forward.

### 🌿 The Invitation

This is the work of the **Amplifying Your Strengths Session**—a dedicated 1:1 space where your unique strengths are brought forward and integrated into the moments that matter most.

In this session, we’ll take the very real scenarios where your quietness has felt overpowering, and use your signature strengths as a guide so that your presence naturally carries more weight—without forcing yourself to be louder or someone you’re not.

### Who This Is For
This session is for quiet, thoughtful leaders who want to be recognized for their impact—without forcing themselves to become louder or someone they’re not.

You might be:
- A new manager navigating leadership for the first time.
- A seasoned leader whose contributions are strong but often overlooked in louder rooms.
- A team lead who wants to amplify not only your own strengths but also create space for your people to shine.
- A professional stepping into higher visibility roles and wanting to do so authentically.


This is especially for you if you’ve ever wondered:

- “Am I being overlooked because I don’t take up as much space?”
- “How can I and my team be seen without selling myself and them constantly?”
- “Is there a way to lead quietly and still be recognized?”
- “Will the work my team does go unnoticeable if I don’t constantly advocate for them?”


If you resonate with these questions, you are exactly who this session was created for.

### Testimonials
*“I have found Amy’s coaching style and sessions to be incredibly helpful in determining how best to leverage the strengths of myself and my team(s) and navigating challenging situations!  Amy excels at not only listening to the information and challenges I share with her, but also hearing and picking up what I may not be saying or seeing myself.  She will reflect things back to me in ways that help me see different perspectives or alternatives to approaching a situation, or reframe an idea in a way that is much better suited for whatever I might be facing.  This has enabled me to tap into my existing strengths while bolstering other areas in ways that are consistent with my values and align with the goals I am trying to achieve.  Thank you, Amy!”* – Carlo C, Senior Engineering Leader


### FAQ

**I’m not in a formal leadership role yet—can this still help?**

 Yes. Leadership shows up in many ways, not only in titles. If you’ve ever led a project, guided others, or carried responsibility, this space will be valuable for you.

**I don’t think of myself as “quiet.” Is this for me?**

 If anything here resonates, you’re welcome. Many people find parts of themselves reflected in this description, even if they wouldn’t label themselves “quiet.”

**Does this really work?**

 Yes. I’ve helped leaders use this framework to lean into their strengths in difficult meetings, job interviews, and tough conversations. Clients often leave with clarity they can apply right away.

**Will this solve all my challenges right away?**

 No single session can do that. Growth takes practice and time. What this session offers is a clear starting point: insight into your unique strengths and a practical way to apply them so you can begin to feel recognized in real situations.

**Why does this cost money?**

 I’ve set the price as accessibly as I can. Coaching is also an exchange of energy—your investment helps you commit to the process, and it supports me to continue offering this work.

**What if I truly can’t afford this?**

 If you deeply resonate but can’t make the investment right now, I keep a few sliding-scale spots available. Please reach out in this sliding scale request form if this speaks to you.

**Can’t I just take the test and buy the report and get the same value without the coaching session?**

 You could. But many people take assessments, feel a spark of recognition, and then never use the results again. The value of this session is in integration—guidance to work with your strengths immediately in a real scenario, and a framework you can use moving forward. That’s where the shift happens.

**There are so many assessment tests out there. Why are you using VIA Character Strengths?**

 VIA is simple, accessible, and research-backed. Even the free results can give you valuable insights to start working with right away. I love using it because it gives us a clear, practical language for your natural strengths—and together, we can translate those insights directly into the real situations you’re facing.

**What if I don’t know what scenario to bring?**

 That’s okay. We can identify one together in our session. Often the most valuable moments come from real situations you didn’t even realize were weighing on you.

**Why are there no available time slots right now?**

I only open my calendar about two weeks in advance and hold sessions during dedicated times each week so I can give you my full attention and energy. Life can happen to all of us, and this approach helps me stay flexible and fully present for you. If no time slots are available, please [join the waitlist here](https://forms.gle/JPEdmr5xzLHqXN2L6) — I’ll notify you as soon as new sessions open up.

**Can I get a refund?**

I don’t offer refunds, but I completely understand that life happens. If something comes up, I’m happy to help you reschedule your session so we can meet at a better time for you.

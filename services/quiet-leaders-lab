A monthly space for quiet leaders to lead more at ease and more true to themselves.

Quiet Leaders Lab is a free, monthly gathering for quiet, thoughtful leaders who want to slow down, notice how they’re showing up as leaders, and explore experiments that help them lead more at ease and more true to themselves.

Each month, we’ll hold one guiding question together (for example: *How do I want to relate to visibility in a way that feels more at ease and more true to me?*).

We’ll spend time:

- Checking in
- Exploring the question through gentle, facilitated conversation
- Identifying a small, personal experiment to carry into the coming month

This is not a workshop or training. There’s no fixing, no pressure to speak, and no expectation to arrive with answers.

It’s a shared space to notice, reflect, and experiment gently — alongside other quiet leaders.

**Come as you are. Leave with something small and true to try.**

**Participation is free.** If you’d like to contribute, a suggested optional donation of $10 helps support the Lab and keeps it sustainable.

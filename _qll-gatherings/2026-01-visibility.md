## About this gathering

This month’s focus is **Visibility**.

​What is your relationship with visibility right now? Does it feel too performative? Does it feel too exposed? We’ll explore what it’s like to be seen (or not seen), what feels calming or restless around visibility, and what kinds of visibility feel supportive rather than draining.

​We’ll spend time:
- ​Checking in
- ​Exploring the question through gentle, facilitated quiet reflection
- ​Identifying a small, personal experiment to carry into the coming month

​This is not a workshop or training. There’s no fixing, no pressure to speak, and no expectation to arrive with answers.

​It’s a shared space to notice, reflect, and experiment gently — alongside other quiet leaders.

## Event Recap

We began with our guiding question:
- How do I want to relate to visibility in a way that feels more at ease and more true to me?

We then moved into a quiet reflection on the *now*:
- What’s your relationship with visibility right now?

As we reflected, we explored questions such as:
- What is your definition of visibility?
- What does visibility mean to you?
- What are you currently doing — or not doing — around visibility?
- How does being seen (or not seen) make you feel?
- How do you want to be seen — or not seen?
- What do you want people to notice about you or your work?
- What assumptions do you hold about visibility?
- What values feel in tension with being visible?

In our sharing, we named several challenges that resonate deeply with many quiet leaders. We often feel a strong pull to create space for others and to be thoughtful about where and how we show up. Even when our strengths are visible, our leadership may still be underestimated or misunderstood. Over time, that lack of recognition can run so deep that when our strengths are finally named, we may struggle to fully see or trust them ourselves.

We closed by designing a small experiment for the coming month:
- What is one small experiment you can try this month to relate to visibility in a way that feels more at ease and more true to you?

Some experiment ideas we explored included:
- Gently test an assumption you hold about visibility
- Try one small thing you usually avoid
- Notice your feelings when you’re seen — especially the subtle ones
- Listen to what those feelings might be pointing to
- Explore a different way you want to be seen
- See how visibility and a conflicting value might coexist
- Identify what support would make this easier

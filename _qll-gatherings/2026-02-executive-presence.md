## About this gathering

Visibility can feel deeply uncomfortable for quiet leaders.

There’s often a pull to stay focused on the work, support others, and avoid the spotlight — and at the same time, a growing awareness that being unseen can limit impact, recognition, and growth.

In this session, we explored how visibility doesn’t have to mean being louder, faster, or more performative — and what it *can* look like when it’s grounded and intentional.

## Reflection questions

- Where do I already show up in quiet but meaningful ways?
- What stories do I tell myself about visibility?
- What kind of visibility feels aligned — not forced — right now?
- What’s one small, safe step toward being seen?

## About this gathering

This month’s focus is **Executive Presence**.

What does executive presence mean to *you*?

​Many quiet leaders receive feedback that we “lack executive presence” or “leadership potential.” When we hear this, it can feel like an invisible ceiling — something undefined yet powerful — standing between us and our next step.

​In this session, we’ll gently explore:
- ​How executive presence is defined — by us and by others
- ​The gap between how our leadership is experienced internally and how it’s perceived externally
- ​What feels true, misaligned, or unclear about common expectations of executive presence
- ​Where pressure, assumptions, or cultural norms may be shaping this feedback

​Rather than trying to “fix” ourselves, we’ll slow down and notice what’s actually happening — and what kind of presence feels most authentic and sustainable for us.

​We’ll spend time:
- ​Checking in
- ​Exploring the question through gentle, facilitated quiet reflection
- ​Identifying a small, personal experiment to carry into the coming month

​This is not a workshop or training. There’s no fixing, no pressure to speak, and no expectation to arrive with answers.

​It’s a shared space to notice, reflect, and experiment gently — alongside other quiet leaders.

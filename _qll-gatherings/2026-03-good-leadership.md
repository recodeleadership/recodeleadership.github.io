## About this gathering

This month’s focus is **Good Leadership**.

What does good leadership actually look like?

Many quiet leaders observe leadership that isn’t centered on being loud or dominant. The leadership behaviors we experience as “good” often make us feel calm, supported, and grounded.

​In this session, we’ll gently explore:
- How we understand good leadership — from our own lived experience and from others’ expectations
- Which leadership characteristics we may be holding onto that don’t truly fit us (or may not be true)
- The gap between how we’re currently showing up as leaders and how we want to lead
- What kind of leadership feels most authentic and sustainable for us to practice

​Rather than trying to “fix” ourselves, we’ll slow down and notice what’s actually happening — and what kind of presence feels most authentic and sustainable for us.

​We’ll spend time:
- ​Checking in
- ​Exploring the question through gentle, facilitated quiet reflection
- ​Identifying a small, personal experiment to carry into the coming month

​This is not a workshop or training. There’s no fixing, no pressure to speak, and no expectation to arrive with answers.

​It’s a shared space to notice, reflect, and experiment gently — alongside other quiet leaders.
